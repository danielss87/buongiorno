# ☀️☕ Buongiorno

---

Buongiorno is a tool for the retail investor. 
Because no one wants to stop your work to do day trading.

Instead of complex charts, it tells only one thing: where to re-alocate your money today.

The name 'Buongiorno' - the italian word for "good morning" is intended to this 'once a day' feeling.
